# Chapter 2: Characters


## Creating a Character

You've taken the first step on your adventure, but you are still a 0th level human. Don't despair, because you become 1st level when you create your first character, and progress from there! To create a character, follow the nine steps below:

1. Start with a fresh character sheet. You can copy the one provided in this book, download and print one, or reproduce it by hand on a piece of paper. If all else fails, just scribble down notes on scratch paper!

2. Roll 3d6 in order for your character's ability scores, as described below under Character Abilities, and write the results after the names of the abilities. Write down the ability score bonus or penalty for each score, as shown on the [Ability Score](Chapter02.md#ability-score) table.

3. Choose a class which suits your character's abilities from the [Character Classes](Chapter02.md#character-classes) section. All classes have prime requisites, and some classes require minimum scores for some abilities. If abilities are not quite high enough for the class you would like to play, see [Classes and Ability Scores](Chapter02.md#classes-and-ability-scores) for some options to adjust your scores. Write down the special abilities of your class, as described for each class.

4. Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0) experience points (or XP); you may also want to note the number needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for your class. Gaining experience points is explained in the [Adventures](Chapter06.md#chapter-6-adventures) and [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapters.

5. Roll hit points (hp) using the appropriate die for your class, adding your Constitution bonus or penalty, and note the result as your hit points on your character sheet. If your character has a Constitution penalty, the penalty will not lower any Hit Die roll below 1. (At your Judge's discretion, you may begin with the maximum hit points for 1st level.)

6. Record your character's attack throws and saving throws on your character sheet. Attack throws and saving throws are listed with each class, and described fully in the [Adventures](Chapter06.md#chapter-6-adventures) chapter. Note that attacks with melee weapons are modified by your Strength, while missile weapons such as bows or thrown daggers are modified by Dexterity. Don't forget to adjust your attack throws to reflect these modifiers.

7. Choose your character's starting proficiencies from the [Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#chapter-4-proficiencies) chapter. Apply any modifiers to your ability scores, hit points, attack throws, or saving throws from proficiencies. If you have chosen to play a mage or elven spellsword, roll for your starting spells, as described in the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter.

8. Generate your character's starting wealth by rolling 3d6x10 gold pieces (gp) and purchase equipment for your character from the lists in the [Equipment](Chapter03.md#chapter-3-equipment) chapter. Write your purchases on your character sheet, and note how much money remains afterward. Make sure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for your class before making your purchases. Since you now know what armor your character is wearing, note your Armor Class (AC) on the character sheet based on the type of armor you choose. Don't forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to AC. Likewise, record your weapon damages based on the type of weapons you choose, modified by your Strength bonus or penalty. Calculate your character's encumbrance based on how much weight he is carrying.

9. Give your character a name, and create a description of what your character looks like, his personality, and maybe even a brief note about the character's background. Then choose an appropriate Alignment for your character. Your Judge will have information on the setting of your character's world that can be helpful in naming your new character and developing his background.


### Creating Characters with Templates

To speed up the character creation process, a player may opt to roll for a character's proficiencies and equipment using a template. To create a character this way, follow the above instruction through step 6, then follow the instructions below. 

7. Find the appropriate template table for your character’s class at the end of this chapter. With the Judge’s permission, choose a template appropriate to the campaign. Otherwise, roll 3d6 on the table to determine your character’s starting template. Note down your character’s starting proficiencies from the table. All characters always begin with the Adventuring proficiency in addition to those listed. Apply any modifiers to your ability scores, hit points, attack throws, or saving throws from proficiencies. If you have chosen to play a magic-user, note down the starting ceremonies or spells from your template.

8. Write your character’s starting equipment and gold pieces as listed for your template. You do not roll for starting wealth when using a template. Since you now know what armor your character is wearing, note your Armor Class (AC) on the character sheet based on the type of armor you choose. Calculate your character’s encumbrance based on how much weight he is carrying.

9. Give your character a name, and create a description of what your character looks like, his personality, and maybe even a brief note about the character’s background. Then choose an appropriate Alignment for your character. Your Judge will have information on the setting of your character’s world that can be helpful in naming your new character and developing his background.


### Generating Multiple Characters (Optional)

As an optional rule, at the start of play, each player generates five characters and select one primary and two back-up characters. The remaining two characters are given to the Judge to use as NPCs to populate the campaign setting. If the primary and back-ups are all killed, the player generates five additional characters, again picking three and giving the Judge two. This ensures that the player always has a variety of characters to choose from to find one he likes, and gives the Judge some additional NPCs to populate the world.


## Character Abilities

Character Abilities must be determined by rolling randomly. Roll 3d6 for each ability in the order listed below. As an optional rule, the Judge may allow you to roll 6 scores and then assign them to your abilities in any order you desire.

When complete, your character will have a score ranging from 3 to 18 in each of the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with each score, as shown on the table below. Each class has one or more prime requisite ability scores, which affect the rate at which the character will earn experience points. Some class may have other minimum ability requirements which must be met in addition.

#### Ability Score

| Ability Score | Bonus/Penalty
| :------------ | ------------:
| 3             |            -3
| 4-5           |            -2
| 6-8           |            -1
| 9-12          |             0
| 13-15         |            +1
| 16-17         |            +2
| 18            |            +3

**Strength**: As the name implies, this ability measures the character's raw physical power. Strength is a prime requisite for assassins, explorers, and fighters. Apply the ability bonus or penalty for Strength to all attack throws and damage rolls in melee (hand-to-hand) combat. Note that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful attack below one point, unless the target is otherwise invulnerable to the attack (see the [Adventures](Chapter06.md#chapter-6-adventures) chapter for details).

**Intelligence**: This is the ability to learn and apply knowledge. Intelligence is a prime requisite for witches and loremasters. The ability bonus for Intelligence is added to the number of proficiencies the character begins play with (see the [Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#chapter-4-proficiencies) chapter for details) and the number of languages the character is able to learn to read and write, as described below. Magic-users increase the number of ceremonies or spells of each level in their repertoire by their Intelligence bonus (see the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter for details).

All characters begin the game knowing their native language. A character with an Intelligence penalty will only know his native language, and cannot read more than a word or two. Characters with at least average Intelligence (9-12) will be literate in any languages they can speak. Characters with an Intelligence bonus may begin the game knowing one or more languages other than those given above; the number of additional languages that may be learned is equal to the Intelligence bonus (+1, +2, or +3). The player may also choose to leave one or more bonus language "slots" open, to be filled during play.

**Wisdom**: A combination of intuition, willpower and common sense. Wisdom is a prime requisite for runemakers, witches, and loremasters. The Wisdom bonus or penalty applies to all saving throws.

**Dexterity**: This ability measures the character's quickness and balance as well as his aptitude with tools. Dexterity is a prime requisite for assassins, bards, explorers, and thieves. A character's Dexterity bonus or penalty is applied to his attack throws with missile weapons, Armor Class value, and Initiative die rolls.

**Constitution**: Constitution is a combination of general health and vitality. Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each Hit Die rolled by the character. Note that a penalty here cannot reduce any Hit Die roll to less than 1 point.

**Charisma**: This is the ability to influence or even lead people; those with high Charisma are well-liked, or at least highly respected. Charisma is a prime requisite for bards. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to the character's reaction rolls. Charisma also determines the maximum number of henchmen the character may employ, and modifies their morale. The number of henchmen a character may hire is equal to 4 plus the Charisma bonus or penalty (and therefore ranges from 1 to 7); the average morale of any such henchmen will be 0, modified by the character's Charisma bonus or penalty.


### Classes and Ability Scores

Once abilities have been determined, each player must choose a class. Each class has one or more prime requisite ability scores. A character must have an ability score of at least 9 in a class's prime requisite(s) in order to choose a particular class. Some classes have additional minimum ability score requirements. A character must have the minimum required ability, if one is indicated, in order to choose a particular class.

If a character's prime requisite ability is high enough, the character will receive a bonus to experience points earned during play. The [Ability Prime Requisite](Chapter02.md#ability-prime-requisite) table, below, details the effect a score in a prime requisite has on experience points earned by characters. If a class has two prime requisites, calculate the character's experience adjustment based on whichever prime requisite has the lower ability score.

#### Ability Prime Requisite

| Score | Experience Adjustment
| :---- | --------------------:
| 9-12  |                    0%
| 13-15 |                   +5%
| 16-18 |                  +10%

~~Once a player has selected his character class, he may raise the class's prime requisite ability or abilities if desired by sacrificing points in other abilities. 2 ability points may be sacrificed from an ability to raise a prime requisite ability 1 point. This may be done more than once, but no ability can be lowered below 9, and no ability may be lowered if it is also a prime requisite for the class, even if there are a few points to spare above the minimum required score.~~


## Hit Points

Hit points are a measure of a character's ability to survive in combat. When a character, or any other being, is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, he is incapacitated and possibly dead. Hit points are not a direct representation of the character's capacity to receive physical injury. Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant.

Each character class rolls a different kind of die to determine hit points, as noted in the [Character Classes](Chapter02.md#character-classes) section, based on their toughness in battle. One die is rolled at first level, and further dice are rolled and cumulatively added to the total hp for each level of experience, unless otherwise noted. One optional rule, to allow first level characters to be hardier, is for the Judge to allow all hp rolls for first level characters to be considered the maximum result (e.g. an 8 for fighters or a 6 for clerics.)


## Character Classes

The classes described in these rules are the [fighter](Chapter02.md#fighter), [explorer](Chapter02.md#explorer), [freebooter](Chapter02.md#freebooter), [bard](Chapter02.md#bard), [thief](Chapter02.md#thief), [runemaker](Chapter02.md#runemaker), [witch](Chapter02.md#witch), and [loremaster](Chapter02.md#loremaster).

Selecting equipment and proficiencies can be time-consuming, especially for new players. As a faster alternative, we offer a pre-generated template for each class, with weapons, armor, equipment, proficiencies, and spells ready for play. This default suggested template may always be taken, or a player may choose to roll for a template as described [above](Chapter02.md#creating-characters-with-templates). 


### Fighter

| Prime Requisite: | STR
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d8
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Fighters are exclusively trained in the arts of combat and war. They are specialists at dealing physical blows. Fighters may have learned their arts as warriors, gladiators battling for glory in the arena, raiders, or sell-swords in the games of the noble houses.

As their name suggests, fighters are exceptionally skilled combatants. Fighters are trained in the use of all weapons and armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a two-handed weapon, or wielding a weapon in each hand, as desired. At first level, fighters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (the best progression of any class). Fighters also increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

When a fighter reaches 5th level (Exemplar), his battlefield prowess inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the fighter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the fighter's Charisma or proficiencies.

At 9th level (Warlord), a fighter can, assuming enough gold is at hand, build a castle and become a great leader of men, taking a leadership rank in his society. When he does so, up 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 fighters of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Through force of arms, the fighter may ultimately control several castles or even entire realms, but must be a capable, strong leader and provide protection. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.


| Template:           | Mercenary

| Proficiencies:      | Combat Reflexes, Manual of Arms
| Starting Equipment: | Well-oiled sword, metal shield re-painted many times, slightly battered chainmail armor, crossbow, case with 20 quarrels,  military tunic, boots, backpack, 2 week's iron rations

This pre-generated template represents a wary sellsword. The template is ready for adventure. However, if your fighter's INT is 13 or greater, you may pick one or more additional general proficiencies before play if you'd like (see [Starting Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#starting-proficiencies) in Chapter 4).

### Explorer

| Prime Requisite: | STR and DEX
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Explorers are scouts and trackers, adept at both woodcraft and archery. Few adventuring parties would dare the wilderness without an experienced explorer to guide them. An explorer might be a long range scout, a barbarian hunter from the northern forests, or a settler pushing past the borders civilization.

While they prefer to evade foes where possible, explorers are cunning warriors when they need to be. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. At first level, explorers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. In addition, they gain an accuracy bonus of +1 to all attack throws with missile weapons. Due to their careful aim, they increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Explorers are trained to fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wear chain mail or lighter armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

Explorers have animal reflexes, gaining +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. Outdoors, explorers are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, an explorer who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20.

Parties guided by explorers gain significant advantages on wilderness adventures. Any time the explorer's party is in country familiar to the explorer, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the explorer's party receives a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters.

A party guided by an explorer can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised on a proficiency throw of 19+. See the [Wilderness Adventures](Chapter06.md#wilderness-adventures) and [Evasion and Pursuit](Chapter06.md#evasion-and-pursuit) sections of Chapter 6 for more details on getting lost and evading encounters.

When an explorer reaches 5th level (Guide), his experience and hardiness reassures those who follow him into the wild. Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by the explorer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the explorer's Charisma or proficiencies.

When an explorer reaches 9th level (Warden), he may decide to build a border fort in the borderlands or wilderness. When he does so, up to 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 explorers of 1st - 3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. The character becomes the warden of any nearby settlers, and will attract more settlers over time. These people will look to the Warden as their leader, responsible for the growth and safety of their settlement. Additional rules for border forts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Freebooter

*They lived by thievery, robbery, bodyguarding, brief commissions as couriers and agents—commissions they always, or almost always, fulfilled punctiliously—and by showmanship, the Mouser entertaining by legerdemain, juggling, and buffoonery, while Fafhrd with his gift for tongues and training as a singing skald excelled at minstrelsy. They never worked as cooks, clerks, carpenters, tree-fellers, or common servants...*  – The Circle Curse, in Swords Against Death (Fritz Leiber)

| Prime Requisite: | DEX (plus one ability score determined by path)
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Freebooters are a motley assortment of adventurers who live and die for plunder. Some freebooters are dauntless expeditionaries who raid tombs for ancient treasures. Others may be brutal ruffians who rob and ravage the weak and foolish, cunning scoundrels with the charisma to convince their marks to hand over their wealth willingly, or hardy wayfarers who exact a toll on any who cross the roads and trails of their wilderness homes. Whatever their particular path to plunder, wayfarers share a lust for adventure, a taste for gold, and a willingness to resort to subterfuge and backhanded tactics without hesitation.  

Like thieves, freebooters often belong to a criminal guild which offers shelter and information between heists. At the Judge’s discretion, a freebooter may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for protection. In the Auran Empire, freebooters are everywhere, from the slums of the ports of Kushtu to the highest halls of the Senate in Aura.

Freebooters are ruthless, dirty combatants. At first level, freebooters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws by two points every three levels of experience. However they advance in saving throws like thieves, by two points every four levels of experience.

All freebooters may wear leather armor or lighter, and may wield crossbows, daggers, shortbows, short swords, and swords, as well as five other weapons determined by their path (see below). They may fight wielding a weapon two-handed and wielding a weapon in each hand, but may not use shields.  They may only use magic items usable by thieves.

Lacking the staying power of fighters, freebooters prefer to strike from ambush and finish their foes quickly. A freebooter whose opponent is unaware of his presence can backstab him. When backstabbing, the freebooter receives an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deals additional damage for every four levels he has attained. A freebooter at 1st through 4th levels does double the normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does quintuple the normal damage.

Freebooters increase their damage from their choice of either missile or melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. The freebooter must choose which type of attack will receive the damage bonus at 1st level, and may not change the choice as he advances (i.e. they may choose to be either melee or missile specialists).

A freebooter’s plundering pursuits are shaped by his path to wealth. There are four paths to wealth available to a freebooter: Expeditionary, Ruffian, Scoundrel, and Wayfarer. Each path offers a different set of abilities reflecting that path’s preferred methods to accumulate wealth. When a freebooter is created, select a path for the character from the Paths to Wealth table below, and write down the proficiencies and powers of the path. Each path teaches the use of a selection of five additional weapons, trains the character in four thief skills, and grants five bonus proficiencies. Note that each path has its own prime requisite in addition to DEX.

| Path | Description
| :--- | :----------
| Expeditionary	| A looter of tombs and a delver of dungeons, skilled in scouting, trap-finding, and lock-picking.
| Ruffian | A cut-throat and killer, skilled in breaking and entering, robbery, and intimidation.
| Scoundrel | A gentleman thief, skilled in subterfuge and disguise.
| Wayfarer | A highwayman, outrider, or scout, skilled in hunting, trapping, and survival.

At the Judge’s discretion, a freebooter may follow a unique path, outside of the four listed above. The player and Judge should collaborate to choose five weapons, four thief skills, and five bonus proficiencies that are appropriate to the freebooter.

#### Path of Expeditionary

Prime Requisite: WIS<br>
Weapons:  hand axe, pole arm, spear, staff, war hammer<br>
Thief Skills:  find traps, open locks, move silently, remove traps<br>
Bonus Proficiencies:  Alertness, Climbing, Dungeon Bashing, Mapping, Trap Finding


The expeditionary is a looter of tombs and a delver of dungeons. He often serves as point-man on dungeon delves due to his ability to find both secret doors and traps more effectively than almost any other adventurer. His ability to climb walls and move silently allows him to scout ahead undetected by listening guards, while his training in disarming traps, opening locks, and bashing doors enables him to penetrate almost any obstacle in his path to plunder. Expeditionaries are also excellent map-makers and most treasure maps are created by them.

#### Path of Ruffian
Prime Requisite: STR <br>
Weapons: battle axe, club, morning star, sap, whip<br>
Thief Skills: hide in shadows, move silently, open locks, pick pockets<br>
Bonus Proficiencies: Dungeon Bashing, Fighting Style (ruffian’s choice), Intimidation, Skulking, Swashbuckling

The ruffian is a cut-throat and killer. A ruffian can cut the purses of passersby, skulk in the shadows to waylay unsuspecting victims, break into homes and burglarize their valuables, or simply rely on his threatening demeanor and martial prowess to rob victims at sword-point. Most freebooters are ruffians, and they can be found in great numbers in any den of scum and villainy.

#### Path of Scoundrel
Prime Requisite: CHA<br>
Weapons: arbalest, dart, mace, sap, whip<br>
Thief Skills: hide in shadows, move silently, open locks, pick pockets<br>
Bonus Proficiencies: Cat Burglary, Climbing, Disguise, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading

The scoundrel is a gentleman thief. His ability to scale walls, open locks, hide in shadows, and move silently enables him to function as nigh-undetectable cat burglar, stealing his victims’ most precious treasures without need for violence. An expert in disguise, he can blend in to any crowd, where his graceful sleight-of-hand can relieve his marks of their important papers and burdensome purses. Skilled eavesdroppers and lip readers, scoundrels often work as spies and secret agents, uncovering secrets that the powerful wish to keep hidden.

#### Path of Wayfarer
Prime Requisite: CON<br>
Weapons: bola, hand axe, longbow, net, staff<br>
Thief Skills: climb walls, hear noise, hide in shadows, move silently<br>
Bonus Proficiencies: Land Surveying, Running, Sniping, Skirmishing, Tracking

The wayfarer is a highwayman, outrider, and scout. He excels at hit-and-run attacks, sniping from the cover of darkness and brush, then falling back swiftly and silently into the wilderness. He has the ability to move through the wilderness at great speed, and can navigate mountainous terrain, climb trees, and scale precipices that halt pursuers. If inclined to law, wayfarers may use their expertise in tracking and land surveying to discover monster lairs in the wilderness for adventuring parties or local garrisons.

While each path of freebooter knows different thief skills, all follow the same progression of improvement, as shown on the Freebooter (Thief) Skill Progression table, below.

When a freebooter attains 9th level (Freebooter Captain), he can establish a hideout, and 2d6 freebooter apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. The freebooters will be of the same path as their captain. If hired, they must be paid standard rates. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the Campaign chapter.

Freebooter Proficiency List: Acrobatics, Alertness, Arcane Dabbling, Blind Fighting, Bribery, Cat Burglary, Ceremonial Magic, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, incapacitate), Contortionism, Fighting Style, Lip Reading, Lockpicking, Loremastery, Magical Music, Martial Training, Mountaineering, Passing Without Trace, Precise Shooting, Running, Skirmishing, Skulking, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Trap Finding, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus*

### Bard

| Prime Requisite: | DEX and CHA
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Successful adventurers live forever in the sagas and songs about their deeds. Remembering and recounting these sagas is the profession of bards. Most bards are content to recite the deeds of others, but some bold few participate in the dangers themselves and become inspiring heroes in their own right. A bard might be an adventuring minstrel with a sword in his hand and a song at his lips, a warrior-skald, or haughty aristocrat.

Bards advance in attack throws and saving throws as a thief, by two points every four levels of experience. At first level, bards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They may fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wield a weapon in each hand if desired. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields.

All bards can sing, recite poetry, or play a group of instruments in a skilled manner. The bard chooses the type of performance that his character knows. A bard may take the Perform proficiency to learn other types of performances (see [Chapter 4, Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#chapter-4-proficiencies)).

By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can inspire courage. Inspiring courage requires  a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and grants the bard's allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. (Even the most inspiring epic gets old if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.

Because of their study of ancient annals and legends, bards possess loremastery. This knowledge allows them to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, identify historic artifacts, and similar tasks. At 1st level, a bard must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 to succeed in these tasks. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level.

This same knowledge allows bards to dabble in the arcane. They may attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic Items only useable by mages. At 1st level, the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge's discretion). The proficiency throw required reduces by 2 per level, to a minimum of 3+.

Upon attaining 4th level (Annalist), the bard gains the ability to read languages, including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings. A proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20 is required. If the roll does not succeed, the bard may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a bard reaches 5th level (Chronicler), his chronicles of battle inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score if the bard is there to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard's Charisma or proficiencies.

Upon reaching 9th level (Bard), a bard can build a hall and become a ruler. When he does so, up 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 bards of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Additional rules for halls are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 10th level, the bard can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

This pre-generated template represents a wandering minstrel with magic in his song. The template is ready for adventure. However, if your bard's INT is 13 or greater, you may pick one or more additional general proficiencies before play if you'd like (see [Starting Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#starting-proficiencies) in Chapter 4).

### Thief

| Prime Requisite: | DEX
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Thieves have a range of unique skills associated with their profession that make them very handy companions in adventures. However, thieves can be a bit shady and they sometimes are not as trustworthy as other classes. A thief will usually belong to a Thieves' Guild from the character's local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. At the Judge's discretion, a thief may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for protection. Thieves are everywhere, from the slums to the highest halls of the government.

Thieves are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. At first level, thieves hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. Because of their need for stealth and free movement, thieves cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields or exclusively two-handed melee weapons such as great axes or polearms. They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight with a one-handed weapon in each hand, or wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands.

A thief also has the ability to backstab. He must catch an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows to sneak up on his opponent. When backstabbing, the thief will receive an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deal additional damage for every four levels he has attained. A thief at 1st through 4th levels does double the normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does quintuple the normal damage.

Thieves have the following range of skills, which improve as the thief gains levels according to the progression on the [Thief Skills](Chapter02.md#thief-skills) table. When a thief attempts to make use of one of his skills, the character or Judge will make a proficiency throw of 1d20. (Usually the Judge will make rolls for these abilities, because a thief is not always aware when he has failed.) After applying any relevant modifiers (e.g. due to the complexity of a lock), the result is compared to the target value listed on the [Thief Skills](Chapter02.md#thief-skills) table below for the appropriate skill. A result that is greater than or equal to the value listed for the proficiency throw that corresponds to the thief's level is a success. A roll of 20 is always a success, and a roll of 1 is always a failure.

**Opening Locks**: With the aid of thieves' tools, a thief may pick mechanical locks. He may only try to pick a particular lock once, and if he fails, he may not try the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the lock.

**Finding and Removing Traps**: Through careful inspection and probing, a thief may find hidden traps and then attempt to disable or discharge the trap harmlessly. A thief may only try to find or remove a trap once in any given area. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the trap. If the thief fails, he may not try again until he reaches a higher experience level. Note that these are separate skills, for a thief must find a trap before he can remove it.

**Picking Pockets**: This skill is the bread and butter of non-adventuring thieves for it is a quick source of income - though not without peril. A throw that is less than half the target value means that the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim's reaction.

**Moving Silently**: Thieves may move with total silence. When successful, even keen eared guards will not hear the movements of a thief. However, the thief always thinks he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise unless and until others react to his presence. Thieves may move silently at  1/2  their standard combat movement rate without penalty. If they move greater than  1/2  speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.

**Climbing Walls**: Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. They require a proficiency throw for each 100' they intend to climb. If the roll fails, they fall a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet. Thieves climb at  1/4  their standard combat movement rate.

**Hiding in Shadows**: A thief may attempt to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. A thief will remain hidden so long as he stays motionless. If he moves, he must make a new proficiency throw to hide.

**Hearing Noises**: Thieves can attempt to listen for noises in a cave or hallway and at a door or other locations. The thief must be quiet and in a quiet environment.

Upon attaining 4th level, a thief gains the ability to read languages (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a thief attains 9th level (Master Thief), he can establish a hideout, and 2d6 thief apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. A successful character might use these followers to start a Thieves' Guild. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 10th level, a thief can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

### Runemaker

*“There are cure runes, and aid runes, and ale runes, and peerless power runes, for all to use unspoiled and unprofaned, to bring about good fortune. Enjoy them if you have learned them, until the gods perish.”* – Brynhild, in The Saga of the Volsungs (Chapter 21)

Runemakers are warriors skilled in the lore of runes, magic sigils that contain eldritch power. Though unable to cast spells in the manner of a mage or wizard, runemakers can accomplish many of the same feats through their runes. Through rune-lore, runemakers can see the future, curse their enemies, and perform other miraculous deeds.  

Runemakers are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters. At first level, runemakers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (a progression mid-way between fighters and mages). Because runemakers lack the broad professional training of the fighter, they may only wear chain mail or lighter armor, and are limited to fighting with the following weapons: Great axe, battle axe, hand axe, shortbow, club, spear, javelin, dagger, sword, two-handed sword.

Those who study runes known that gods and men alike are ruled by fate. At 1st level (Runelearner), a runemaker can cast the runes to receive an augury (as the spell) about what fate has in store. It takes one round to cast the runes. A runemaker must have access to his [runic implements](#traditional-implements) in order to cast the runes, and he can do so only once every 8 hours. (Note that “casting” in this context is analogous to the casting of dice, not the casting of spells).  

Starting at 2nd level (Runecarver), a runemaker begins to learn and perform eldritch ceremonies in the runic tradition. The runemaker’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his repertoire. The number and levels of ceremonies the runemaker can include in his repertoire is shown on the Runemaker Ceremony Progression table, but is increased by his Intelligence bonus. Runemakers can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the [Heroic Magic](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-heroic-magic) chapter.

At 3rd level (Runegiver), a runemaker can curse an enemy with ill fate once per day, by either chanting the curse or activating a curse-pole. Chanting a curse takes one round (10 seconds) and must be done when the target is nearby (within 30’) and in earshot. In combat, chanting a curse must be declared before initiative is rolled, and it fails if the runemaker’s concentration is interrupted before the process is completed (as with casting a spell). Chanting a curse can be a dangerous practice, since most targets take unkindly to being cursed!

As a safer alternative, the runemaker can activate a curse-pole. A curse-pole is an 8’-10’ wooden staff carved with the target’s name and topped with an animal’s severed head or skull. Assuming materials are at hand, it takes 1 hour to carve a curse-pole, 1 turn (10 minutes) to raise it, and finally 1 round (10 seconds) to activate it. The runemaker can be freely interrupted while carving or raising the curse-pole without this affecting the success or failure of his efforts, but if he is interrupted while activating the curse-pole, the curse fails and the whole process must be begun again. A curse-pole can be carved anywhere, but it must be raised and activated within sight of the entrance to the target’s home. A curse-pole cannot be moved once raised, but it can be camouflaged or hidden with magic once placed.

Once the curse is chanted or curse-pole is activated, the target must make a saving throw versus Spells. If the target fails the saving throw, he is cursed and immediately begins to suffer the runemaker’s choice of one of the following three ill fates:
*	-4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1)
*	-4 penalty on attack and saving throws
*	Prime requisite halved (minimum 1)

A curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse spell. A curse caused by a curse-staff can also be removed if the curse-staff is moved or broken. A runemaker can have only one curse in effect at a time; if he curses an enemy while a prior curse is still in effect, the prior curse is immediately removed. Calling down a curse is considered grey magic for purposes of [corruption](Chapter05.md#corruption).

When a runemaker reaches 5th level (Runecrafter), he may begin to research ceremonies, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. Runemakers may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research. Also at 5th level, the runemaker’s widespread renown inspires his hirelings to strive for glory themselves. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the runemaker gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the runemaker’s Charisma or proficiencies.

At 9th level (Runelord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A runemaker may also build or claim a chieftain’s hall when he reaches 9th level. When the runemaker establishes his hall, 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 runemakers of 1st-3rd level seeking the secrets of the runes will join his service. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Runemakers’ halls are otherwise identical to fighters’ castles, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS rulebook.

At 11th level (Runelord), a runemaker may, learn and cast ritual spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the runemaker may create necromantic servants and become undead.

Any time after reaching 11th level, the runemaker can choose to learn the wisdom of the ages. Learning the wisdom of the ages, however, requires a terrible sacrifice – the runemaker must either pluck out his own eye, chop off his own hand, slice off his own ears, or cut off his own nose. The injury must be self-inflicted, and if it is ever healed (through magic) the runemaker loses the wisdom of the ages irrevocably. A runemaker who learns the wisdom of the ages gains insight into secrets of the past, the present, and the future that are hidden from all except the gods. In game terms, the runemaker may cast commune once per week (note that commune is a ritual-level spell in Heroic Fantasy Handbook campaigns).

### Witch

| Prime Requisite: | WIS and INT
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | WIS 13
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14

The ignorant will often refer to any female spellcaster as a witch. Actual witches, however, are practitioners of a distinct craft of
magic. Like priestesses and shamans, witches invoke divine magic, but they do not organize into communities of faith nor do they dedicate themselves to the service of their gods or goddesses. Rather, the relationship of a witch to her divine patron is that of student to teacher, rooted in ancient pacts and secretive traditions. The witch seeks to gain personal knowledge and strength by accepting the guidance and patronage of ancient powers. This quest for knowledge and power often drives witches to become adventurers.

Within the Auran Empire, witches are viewed with deep suspicion by the Empyrean priests, but many rural villages nevertheless have a wise woman with some skill in witchcraft. Witches are fairly common in Southern Argollë, Jutland, Rorn, Kemesh, and the Ivory Kingdoms, each of which has flourishing traditions of witchcraft.

Witches receive little combat training. At first level, witches hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every *six* levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), but they advance in saving throws by two points every *four* levels of experience (i.e. as clerics). They may only fight with clubs, daggers, darts, or staffs. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor.

Starting at 1st level, witches are able to **learn and perform eldritch ceremonies** in their corresponding tradition. A witch’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in her **repertoire**. The number and levels of ceremonies the witch can include in her repertoire is summarized on the Witch Level and Ceremony Progression table, but is increased by her Intelligence bonus. A witch can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics, and can make trinkets to aid her performance of ceremonies. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the Heroic Magic chapter (p. XX).

As they advance in level, witches may add new ceremonies to their repertoire by visiting a coven (see below) and spending one game week per ceremony. Particular covens may only offer particular ceremonies at each level, either due to the limitations of their libraries or doctrinal beliefs. Witches who wish to learn unavailable ceremonies must find or research them on their own. The specific ceremonies taught at any given coven should be determined by the Judge based on his setting.

As part of her training in ceremonial magic, every witch creates a **personal talisman** to aid her in performing ceremonies. The witch’s personal talisman provides a +1 bonus to ceremony throws for ceremonies of one particular type. (The witch may choose from death & necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment & illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification). When the witch advances to 3rd level, her personal talisman can increase its bonus by +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase the bonus to +2 for the current type or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). When the witch reaches 11th level, her personal talisman can increase its bonus by another +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase a +2 bonus to +3 for a current type, or increase a +1 bonus to +2 for a current type, or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). If desired, the witch may increase the bonus afforded by or number of ceremony types covered by her personal talisman by selecting the Personal Talisman proficiency (see p. XX). More information on talismans can be found in the Ceremonial Talismans section of the Heroic Magic chapter (p. XX).

When a witch reaches 3rd level (Siren), she may begin to brew potions. When a witch reaches 5th level (Sibyl), she is able to research spells. Upon reaching 7th level (Sorceress), she may scribe magical scrolls. At 9th level (Witch), she is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, a witch may learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (6th and 7th level) and craft magical constructs. Witches perform such magic research as clerics of their level.

Every witch must belong to a **tradition**, which defines her approach to the magic and her relationship with the gods and spirits that are her source of power. When a witch is created, select a tradition for the character from the Tradition table below, and write down the powers of the tradition. Each provides a special ability at 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th level.

The regions within the Auran Empire campaign setting associated with each tradition are noted below. The Judge may create other traditions for his own campaign setting where necessary.

| Tradition           | Region      | Description
| :------------------ | :---------- | :----------
| Antiquarian         | Auran Empire, Jutland | Wise women who focus on healing and beneficial potions, they practice their traditional craft wherever rural human settlements may be found.
| Chthonic            | Kemesh      | Malefic practitioners who consort with the darkest of powers, reveling in the seduction and corruption of the innocent.
| Sylvan              | Rorn, Southern Argollë | Reclusive witches who travel the borderlands between human settlements and fey forests.

#### Antiquarian Witch
1st level: With simple herbs and medicinal folklore, the antiquarian witch learns to treat ailments and injuries. The witch gains one rank of the **Healing** proficiency.

5th level: The antiquarian witch expands her knowledge of herbs and brews into truly arcane formulations. She gains one rank of **Alchemy** proficiency.
7th level: Poisons are much studied and little feared by the antiquarian witch. She gains the power to **neutralize poison** once per day. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes).

#### Chthonic Witch
1st level: The chthonic witch learns depraved arts of pleasure from the dark powers. She gains the **Seduction** proficiency.
3rd level: The mysteries of death are unlocked for the chthonic witch. She gains the **Black Lore of Zahar** proficiency.
5th level: Few can resist the chthonic witch’s ravishing glamour. The witch gains the **Mystic Aura** proficiency.
7th level: With dark whispers the chthonic witch can dominate the weak-willed. The witch gains the power to **charm person** once per day. Each use takes 1 round (10 seconds).

#### Sylvan Witch
1st level: From long years in the company of wild and fey things, the sylvan witch gains the **Beast Friendship** proficiency.
3rd level: Through fey glamours and bewitching dweomers, the witch can appear however she desires. She gains the power to **change shape** (as a warlock) once per day. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes).
5th level: The sylvan witch becomes one with the forests around her. She gains the **Passing Without Trace** proficiency.
7th level: No longer bound by the humanoid form, the sylvan witch can take on fantastical shapes. The witch gains the power to **polymorph self** once per week. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes).

Upon attaining 9th level (Witch), a witch of any tradition may establish a **coven**, usually in a remote and desolate location. If she does so, he will attract 1d6 apprentices of her tradition between 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 normal women seeking to become witches. Their Wisdom scores will be above average, but many will become fearful of the sacrifices involved and quit after 1d6 months. While in the witch’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the witch builds a **dungeon** beneath or near her coven, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, followed shortly by adventurers seeking to fight them. Witches’ covens are otherwise identical to mages’ sanctums, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.

### Loremaster

| Prime Requisite: | INT and WIS
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | INT 14
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Loremasters pursue knowledge and preserve ancient wisdom handed down from time immemorial. Most loremasters live ascetic lives devoted to annotating and studying the books and scrolls collected by their predecessors. But the boldest and most ambitious become adventurers, delving into the dungeons and tombs of past kingdoms in search of knowledge which has been lost. Wielding secrets forgotten for centuries, these loremasters become the most powerful of their kind, legends whose deeds will become the subject of study by the annalists of the future.

Because of their devotion to study, loremasters receive limited combat training. At first level, loremasters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. half as fast as fighters), though they advance in saving throws by two points every four levels (i.e. as clerics). They may only fight with quarterstaffs, clubs, daggers, and darts. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor. For these reasons, loremasters are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.

The books and scrolls of interest to the loremaster are virtually never written in the Common tongue so loremasters soon become familiar with even the most obscure scripts, codes, and languages. At 1st level, a loremaster may read languages unfamiliar to them (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the loremaster may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

From careful study of ancient annals and legends, loremasters can decipher occult mysteries, remember ancient history, identify historic artifacts, and similar tasks. At 1st level, a loremaster must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 to succeed in loremastery. The proficiency throw for loremastery reduces by 1 per level.

Most importantly, the scholarly pursuits of loremasters allow them to learn and perform eldritch ceremonies in the theurgical tradition. A loremaster’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his repertoire. A loremaster’s repertoire can include a number of eldritch ceremonies up to the number and level of ceremonies listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. A loremaster can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics, and can make trinkets to aid his performance of ceremonies. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the [Heroic Magic chapter](Chapter05.md#ceremonial-magic).

As they advance in level, loremasters may add new ceremonies to their repertoire by visiting an athenaeum or other place of learning (see below) and spending one game week per ceremony. Particular athenaeums may only offer particular ceremonies at each level, either due to the limitations of their libraries or doctrinal beliefs. Loremasters who wish to learn unavailable ceremonies must find or research them on their own. The specific ceremonies taught at any given athenaeum should be determined by the Judge based on his setting.

As part of his training in ceremonial magic, every loremaster creates a personal talisman to aid him in performing ceremonies. The  loremaster’s personal talisman provides a +1 bonus to ceremony throws for ceremonies of one particular type. (The loremaster may choose from death & necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment & illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification). When the loremaster advances to 3rd level, his personal talisman can increase its bonus by +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase the bonus to +2 for the current type or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). When the loremaster reaches 11th level, his personal talisman can increase its bonus by another +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase a +2 bonus to +3 for a current type, or increase a +1 bonus to +2 for a current type, or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). If desired, the loremaster may increase the bonus afforded by, or number of ceremony types covered by, his personal talisman by  selecting the [Personal Talisman proficiency](#personal-talisman). More information on talismans can be found in the [Ceremonial Talismans](Chapter05.md#ceremonial-talismans) section of the Heroic Magic chapter.

When a loremaster reaches 5th level (Scholar), he may begin to research ceremonies, scribe scrolls, brew potions, and make talismans. Loremasters may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research.

When a loremaster reaches 9th level (Loremaster), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A loremaster may also build an athenaeum, typically a great library, when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 apprentices of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 normal men seeking to become loremasters. Their intelligence scores will be above average, but many will become discouraged from the rigorous mental training and quit after 1d6 months. While in the loremaster’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the loremaster builds a menagerie beneath or near his athenaeum, monsters may be collected therein. Loremaster’s athenaeum and menageries are otherwise identical to mages’ sanctums and dungeons, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.

At 11th level, a loremaster may create learn and cast ritual eldritch spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the loremaster may create necromantic servants and become undead.

## Alignment

In the Adventurer Conqueror King System, your character will enter a world of ceaseless violent struggle, where civilization is ever-assailed by forces intent on its destruction. In this perilous realm, he will be called to choose a side: Will he pledge to defend civilization and its allies against those who seek to destroy it? Will he sell his sword to any who can offer fame or fortune? Or will he become an agent of entropy and destruction undermining peace and order? This choice is called Alignment, and the three choices are Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic.

**Law**: Lawful beings believe that civilization is worth fighting for. Despite its vices and villainies, civilization must be defended against those who would destroy it. Lawful beings tend to see wars among civilizations as aiding the cause of Chaos, and so they seek peace among Lawful civilizations where possible. However, Lawful characters are not pacifists, nor are they necessarily altruists. Indeed, most would think something was wrong with a hero who turned down fame and fortune; chests of gold, magnificent weapons, comely consorts, and grants of land are, after all, the rightful rewards for great deeds of valor on behalf of Law.

**Neutrality**: Neutral beings generally enjoy the benefits of law and civilization, but it is not something they directly fight for. They tend to focus on their own ends, whether those are family, fame, fortune, pleasure, or power. A Neutral mercenary might be found fighting on behalf of Law or Chaos; a neutral farmer tends his crops and pays his taxes, whether to the Patriarch or the Lich-King.

**Chaos**: Chaotic beings actively seek to destroy civil society. Chaotic characters are often madmen or cultists of forgotten, chthonic gods. To the extent they have any order at all, societies of Chaotic characters are ruled by force and fear, and are often characterized by all manner of corruption and vice. Even decadent Lawful civilizations at least pay homage to civilizing virtue, but chaotic civilizations embrace their corruption.

Note that a character's choice of Alignment doesn't determine whether or not he takes care of his children, cheats on his wife, or steals from the merchant's guild. It is concerned only with the weighty issue of where his allegiance lies in the grand struggles of existence. To have an alignment of Lawful or Chaotic is to have chosen a side in this perpetual struggle. Many people, choosing no side, are Neutral, although it is important to remember that most Neutrals still want the protection of Law even though they are not willing to die for it. (To paraphrase George Orwell, Neutral humans sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because Lawful heroes stand ready to do violence on their behalf.)

Human vices, such as greed, lust, and vanity, are widespread and common even in Lawful societies. But Chaotic societies are characterized by their monstrous vices: Genocide, human sacrifice, wanton destruction, cannibalism, necrophilia, and so on. Evil is all-too-human in every civilization, but Chaotic is something both less and more than human.

## Adventuring Parties

The worlds of Adventurer Conqueror King are dangerous and hostile. For the sake of survival, characters team up to undertake adventures because any number or type of monsters could lie in wait. Such groups, known as adventuring parties, are generally composed of a diverse array of classes, so that different characters are able to contribute their specific talents for any given situation. A thief can check for traps, for instance, and fighters are good for muscle. Clerics have spells for healing and divination, while mages are capable of powerful offensive and defensive magic.

Occasionally, there are not enough party members to take on the challenges of an adventure. The party may hire NPCs, such as henchmen or mercenaries, for extra hands. The rules for hiring henchmen and mercenaries are discussed in [Chapter 3, Equipment](Chapter03.md#chapter-3-equipment).

When there are only a small number of players, the Judge may allow them to each play more than one character. Nevertheless, in these cases characters belonging to the same player cannot offer each other special treatment, such as trading or giving away riches or magical items, unless the Judge rules it acceptable.

Loremaster Notes: Most characters of this class have above average Intelligence, and the templates above reflect that. Each template assumes that the character has an INT ability score of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell. The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the Intelligence Scores of Arcane Spellcasters section earlier in this Chapter. Also remember that INT of 13 or higher grants bonus languages. 
\*The Elementalist can be changed to other elements by substituting the following spells and talisman for kindle flame and talisman of elemental fire: ice floe (water), sling stone (earth), thunderclap (air).
